    justification: >
      No exploit path in current threat model; monitored weekly.
      Dependency is deep in transitive chain and replacement would require
      major refactoring of core components.
    mitigation_plan: |
      1. Weekly monitoring for patched release
      2. Test with patched version when available
      3. Replace dependency if no fix by 2026-01-15
      4. Temporary network isolation of affected service
